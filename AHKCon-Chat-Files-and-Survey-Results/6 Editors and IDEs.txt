05:12:32	Brian Chamberlain:	Great
05:12:40	TAB Tation:	lol
05:13:03	T N:	Where's Sublime?
05:13:18	Geek Dude:	Behind a licensing popup
05:13:19	Ali Honarjoo:	Where is adventure?
05:13:22	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	vim 😁 jk
05:13:23	TAB Tation:	AHK Playground
05:13:24	Erik Oehm:	AHK Plus Plus VS Code extension is the bomb
05:13:34	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	whats Sublime... just joking..😉
05:13:56	T N:	@Geek Dude Fortunately there's AHK...
05:14:09	Brian Chamberlain:	Isaias converted me to VS Code 😄
05:14:31	Cloaker Smoker:	where emacs option? I edit autohotkey from my elegant lisp powered editor
05:14:41	Geek Dude:	@Enrique I use VIM on my AHK scripts on my hosted services. It has a built in AHK highlighter that works pretty well
05:15:12	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	me too.... until Github integration I was using AHKStudio I know Mr. Chad wilson since G+
05:15:30	Chad Wilson:	LOL Mr.
05:15:43	Joe Glines:	I'm still a huge AHK Studio fan!  :)
05:16:04	TAB Tation:	you don't use notepad?
05:16:21	Ahren Groesch:	that burn
05:16:24	Chad Wilson:	I used Notepad until I wrote Studio.
05:16:40	Joe Glines:	@wow Chad.  That's nuts!
05:16:46	Ahren Groesch:	I used notepad++ for maybe 10 years.
05:17:10	Joe Glines:	I still use SciTE4AutoHotkey for non-AutoHotkey programming
05:17:13	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	O.O notepad..... I could imagine why you had the urge to wrote whole editor
05:17:15	TAB Tation:	I hand write all my code
05:17:22	Kirk Lawrence:	??? Any tips on installing VS code for AHK?
05:17:33	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	@geek, i'm gonna try setting up gvim and try it out again with AHK highlighting
05:17:41	Joe Glines:	@Kirk watch the webinar we did on VS code
05:17:41	Ahren Groesch:	just make sure to add an ahk plugin
05:18:16	Joe Glines:	@kirk  https://the-Automator.com/best-autohotkey-editors-ides/vs-code/
05:18:24	Kirk Lawrence:	thx Joe
05:18:42	Guy Mayer:	how do i get the AHK lexer for AHK
05:18:43	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	@Tab nation Hand writting that overkill, I wana know how much you spent of paper and pens
05:18:48	Geek Dude:	@Xeo786 For a long while my CodeQuickTester had no IDE features beyond "run code". Just a standard edit control That's what eventually lead to me building my own highlighters and word suggestion systems around RichEdit haha
05:18:53	Dimitri Geerts:	I once tried to add V2 syntax to Studio, but could not get it to work. But this file should define the syntax for V2 https://github.com/dmtr99/AHK-Studio/blob/Beta/lib/Languages/ahkv2.xml
05:18:54	Joe Glines:	Yep.  Isaias did an amazing job walking through setting it up and using it with GIT
05:18:54	T N:	I still use a hardware notepad and digitize my AHK code with a scanner & OCR.
05:19:07	Joe Glines:	@Guy watch the webinar.
05:19:53	Guy Mayer:	the v2 link is 404
05:19:58	Geek Dude:	I think tidbit still has/uses the version before I introduced highlighting
05:20:49	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	@Geekdude sensie :) I know your code tester from early days....
05:21:37	Geek Dude:	I remember when maestrith started working on AHK Studio. He tried *hard* to pitch me on the wonders of XML
05:22:04	Ben Sacherich:	Is there an editor or ahk script that will auto-indent existing ahk script?
05:22:22	Geek Dude:	S4AHK, AHK Studio, and CodeQuickTester will do that. VS Code might also?
05:22:29	Anthony Alvarez:	Are there good examples of boilerplate templates to make a new AHK script?
05:22:38	Dimitri Geerts:	I made a tutorial how to add a toolbar similar to Scite to AHK Studio: https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=72250&hilit=studio
05:22:39	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	I expect VS code to give me hints like AHK studio and find myself I am not using AHK studio
05:22:42	Geek Dude:	My site https://p.ahkscript.org can also auto-indent code you give it
05:22:59	TAB Tation:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jPrt4OfF04evmwMqFgzS2j-wpkIlSHxj/view?usp=sharing
05:23:38	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	that link reminds me IRC days when I didnt know how to code...
05:23:44	Geek Dude:	@TAB that gives me a ToS removal notice
05:24:00	TAB Tation:	ugh
05:24:01	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	p.ahkscript.orf
05:24:07	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	orf*
05:24:33	Geek Dude:	https://p.autohotkey.com will also take you there if you prefer
05:25:05	TAB Tation:	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jPrt4OfF04evmwMqFgzS2j-wpkIlSHxj/view
05:25:13	TAB Tation:	work?
05:25:16	Geek Dude:	nope
05:25:20	Joe Glines:	I have over 30 tutorials for studio on my page  https://the-Automator.com/Studio
05:25:21	Cloaker Smoker:	there's a solid number of people migrating to vscode because it supports pretty themes (and because it is nice to use one editor for every language but that's very minor)
05:25:21	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	I am using cellphone 😶
05:25:28	Anthony Alvarez:	Google drive link gives error: We're sorry. You can't access this item because it is in violation of our Terms of Service.
05:25:28	Darrell Metcalf:	What are the top advantages of GIT integration with a AHK IDE?
05:26:08	Dimitri Geerts:	V2 was my trigger to jump from ahk Studio to VS Code
05:26:27	Geek Dude:	@Darrell It's the same as any version control system with any kind of code. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control
05:26:35	Mage Prometheus:	Rust and Lua are easy in VSC and it's been 20+ years since I've used vi and vim. Too old to learn another editor now.
05:27:22	Geek Dude:	It lets you keep track of changes made by people, look at the history of how a file has changed, merge changes from multiple people into a single file in a team environment, and gives standardized tools for sharing and distributing code to other people
05:27:30	Joe Glines:	Lots of cool comments here
05:27:42	Dimitri Geerts:	you can press "." in any GitHub website to jump to the online vs code editor
05:28:06	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	that's pretty nifty, didn't know of these features
05:28:14	Geek Dude:	Without version control, if you want to remove a piece of code but still save it for later you might, for example, need to keep it in the file commented out. With git, you can just delete that code and if it turns out you need it later you can rewind and see how the file used to be
05:28:29	Ben Sacherich:	@GeekDude, thanks for the website.  That's perfect.  I use Notepad++ as my editor so I'll be able to utilize the website for quick formatting without installing additional editors.  I made a similar site to format SQL.
05:28:37	Dimitri Geerts:	it is a recent option
05:29:09	Geek Dude:	@Ben you're welcome! The indenting code was actually ported from AHK Studio in 2015
05:29:13	Joe Glines:	git tutorial with vs code and changes  https://youtu.be/xh8G0ipLj84
05:29:23	Ben Sacherich:	+1
05:30:50	Joe Glines:	https://the-Automator.com/Debugging
05:32:13	Geek Dude:	On new computers where I suddenly need AHK, the compiled version of CodeQuickTester is what I grab instead of AHK Portable because it can run AHK code without having an AHK installation on the system.
05:32:27	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	with github API. I think ahk studio can be integrated with github
05:33:14	William Schnepp:	I'm bACK,  we'll, HAVE TO DO THIUS AGAIN NEXT yEAR SO I CAN LEARN WHAT I MISSED
05:33:20	Geek Dude:	AHK Studio does have some GitHub API integration
05:33:33	Geek Dude:	@William lucky for you, I believe Joe is going to upload the sessions to YouTube
05:33:54	Joe Glines:	Yes, they'll be shared later
05:34:08	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	@Geekdude sensei ... O.O really
05:34:09	Ben Sacherich:	@Geek Dude, how can I contact you about a bug in the formatting website?
05:34:54	Geek Dude:	You can join my Discord server at http://geekdude.io/discord or find me in the regular AHK discord
05:36:46	Dimitri Geerts:	The most amazing about multiline is that if you copy paste selection, it takes into account every line separately
05:38:42	T N:	❓❓❓ Does anyone know if there's a way to have VS Code debugger display AHK object structure deeper than three layers?
05:39:56	Joe Glines:	Very cool Dimitri Geerts
05:40:02	Joe Glines:	TN I'll ask in a sec
05:41:03	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	ctl+alt+arrow key up and down to make multilines vscode
05:41:04	Dimitri Geerts:	Ctrl+d is selection the next same word in VS Code, and with F2 you can rename the variable
05:41:50	Geek Dude:	It's fun to see how other people use VS Code. I use the VIM keybinds extension with it so almost everything about interacting with the code area is different
05:42:07	Geek Dude:	For those of you who wish you were using VIM, it's a great option
05:42:26	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	ctrl+alt+mouse clicks to get multiple custom pointers
05:43:31	T N:	In that case the limitation is in inheritance structure, only visible +2 layers deep.
05:43:41	T N:	Like base->base->base
05:45:24	Brian M:	great discussion on editors, thanks all
05:47:46	Geek Dude:	Huh, I never knew there was a shortcut search in VS Code
05:48:02	Geek Dude:	I just hit control-shift-p and type the name of the action I want to do. Very similar to Maestrith's alt-m menu
05:49:08	Anthony Alvarez:	Does anyone know of a AHK script to open application software cheats sheets that is context sensitive based upon the active window?
05:49:34	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	only those who live in coding wonderland can utilize full extent of vscode, like walking sitting sleeping eating waking up with code 😆, just look at those hotkeys list Man...! 🙄
05:49:35	Isaias Baez (RaptorX):	there are none at the moment but we are working on one ^^
05:53:49	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	my code is funky and his code is fun
mefunc(){
}

hisfun(){
}
05:54:56	Ahren Groesch:	Except your wrists
05:56:13	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	we use keyboard and put so much efforts so other does not need to use keyboard anymore and just use mouse....
05:56:45	Ben Sacherich:	Does AHK Studio allow you to step through running code and evaluate variables?
05:57:28	Guy Mayer:	remember the last call where tom showed the "Suggestions" solutions a s they were getting in the way ..
06:00:46	Robert Rosenwald:	❓❓❓Are we running over
06:01:29	Joe Glines:	yes @Ben, you can step through
06:01:58	Joe Glines:	@Robert I think we ran over earlier.  This was set for 1 hour so we're sticking to 1 hour...
06:02:05	Joe Glines:	I think our lunch went long
06:02:24	Geek Dude:	In the email you sent out Joe, IDEs was a half-hour block
06:02:41	Cloaker Smoker:	same with the reddit post afaict
06:03:34	Joe Glines:	Well we're finish up in 12 minutes
06:04:08	Geek Dude:	No worries, this is good stuff
06:04:14	Joe Glines:	Thanks GeekDude
06:06:13	Robert Rosenwald:	This is very good stuff--I was just being pedantic
06:06:24	Joe Glines:	Thanks Robert
06:07:44	Maciej Słojewski:	❓❓❓ Could you please show how to store vscode settings in a cloud?
06:08:13	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	ahkstudio vs code 😇
06:08:54	Geek Dude:	I didn't know VS Code let you do that
06:08:59	Ben Sacherich:	Besides syntax highlighting, are there any plugins or tips for using Notepad++ as the IDE?
06:09:33	Maciej Słojewski:	@Isaias, thanks a lot!
06:09:50	Geek Dude:	@Ben I have my own highlighting settings that are built for the Zenburn dark theme if you're interested
06:09:52	William Schnepp:	iS sITE  ORTABLE?
06:10:07	Cloaker Smoker:	@Ben only thing I can think of is that the debugger plugin on the forums requires using the 32 bit version of n++
06:10:18	Cloaker Smoker:	which was a pain to figure out
06:10:27	Geek Dude:	No wonder I could never get it to work lol
06:10:29	T N:	Any words about VS Code debugger 'Watch' window bugginess or is it just me? Expressions/variable contents often don't seem to display at all.
06:10:34	Isaias Baez (RaptorX):	TextFX
06:10:38	William Schnepp:	sorry   is Scite  portable?
06:10:47	Joe Glines:	SciTE can be portable
06:11:23	William Schnepp:	thanks   Joe
