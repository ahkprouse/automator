04:17:46	Brian Chamberlain:	ü§©This has been great so far!!
04:17:48	Erik Oehm:	Good stuff!  Thanks Joe, Isaias, and everyone!
04:17:54	Ahren Groesch:	I've "learned" regex at least half a dozen times. I use it so infrequently that it never sticks.
04:18:00	TAB Tation:	Welcome
04:18:07	PHILIP DICICCO:	Same Ahren
04:18:23	Erik Oehm:	RegEx makes my head hurt.
04:18:25	TAB Tation:	tried
04:18:39	Descolada:	The second hardest thing after learning Regex is knowing when to use Regex :D
04:18:50	Ben Sacherich:	Regex101.com is my favorite place to test RegEx
04:19:09	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	weirdly, i kinda like creating regex patterns because it's like a puzzle lol
04:19:10	TAB Tation:	whats that?
04:19:18	Joe Glines:	lol
04:19:27	Geek Dude:	I test my RegExes in Discord by sending them to the code bot lol
04:20:32	Joe Glines:	Very cool GeekDude
04:20:41	Geek Dude:	@Enrique if you want a regex puzzle check out https://regexcrossword.com/
04:20:43	Dimitri Geerts:	RegEx is slower than Instr, so using InStr if you can, it is advised
04:21:10	Joe Glines:	@Dimitri, I'd still say "it depends" to your answer
04:21:48	Geek Dude:	If the situation is impacted by a few milliseconds difference, sure I'll use InStr, but the syntax for a regex in-string check is so simple that I use it when time below a few miliseconds doesn't matter
04:22:24	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	thnx @geek!, that'll keep me busy for a while, looks fun üòÅ
04:22:44	TAB Tation:	Is a ahren a model?
04:23:31	Mage Prometheus:	I think they become complex if you start using capturing/non-capturing groups and back references.
04:23:40	Ahren Groesch:	üòÖ
04:23:51	Geek Dude:	When the regular expression starts to get complicated, it can start to out-perform native AutoHotkey code. I have one script with a regular expression I wrote that's 10ish lines long (yes, one regex!) because the equivalent native AHK code would've been too slow for the situation
04:24:53	TAB Tation:	He has the hair I do lol whip ir
04:25:01	TAB Tation:	it*
04:25:24	Joe Glines:	Very cool @GeekDude
04:25:57	Brian Chamberlain:	‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìWould regex be could for searching for common phrases?  Like "user said that....."
04:25:59	Erik Oehm:	I typically know when I SHOULD be using RegEx.  I just can never figure out how to do what I want to do.  If anyone is a RegEx wizard and wants to make $$, I would totally pay someone to write RegEx for me when I need it!
04:26:03	Ben Sacherich:	I've used this Regex trick to save a lot of hair pulling when trying to exclude special cases.https://www.rexegg.com/regex-best-trick.html
04:26:14	Brian Chamberlain:	*good that is
04:26:39	Ahren Groesch:	It does require practice
04:27:01	Geek Dude:	@Erik the AutoHotkey Discord server has a whole #regex channel where you can ask for help writing regexes
04:27:12	Geek Dude:	It may be useful to you in a pinch
04:27:17	Joe Glines:	I didn't know that @GeekDude
04:28:10	TAB Tation:	Isasias has an AHK shirt
04:28:20	Isaias Baez (RaptorX):	yeah
04:28:21	Isaias Baez (RaptorX):	xD
04:28:48	TAB Tation:	Mage looks like he will kill AHK
04:29:13	Ahren Groesch:	https://discord.com/channels/115993023636176902/513105264149266462
04:29:34	Erik Oehm:	Awesome, thanks!
04:30:53	TAB Tation:	he has a shirt that says automatator   !!!!!
04:31:44	TAB Tation:	where is mine
04:32:04	Thomas Kahn:	üòÆ
04:33:18	Mage Prometheus:	Most programs/utilities have the option to use regex in 'find'. Turn it on and start using them to gain the skills.
04:33:43	TAB Tation:	where can I buy?‚ùì
04:33:44	Joe Glines:	Great point @Mage
04:33:56	Ahren Groesch:	"most" I wish
04:34:11	Joe Glines:	It's a really shame MS Word didn't use RegEx instead of writing their own approach
04:34:23	Thomas Kahn:	Amen to that
04:35:20	Geek Dude:	I use Notepad++'s find and replace tool all the time for reformatting text using regular expressions. I'll take a flat list of items and replace ^ to " and then $ to ", and then I have code I can copy and paste into AHK to make an array of strings
04:36:21	Joe Glines:	Yeah, Isaias and Maestrith have done amazing things in VS Code and AHKStudio
04:38:17	Joe Glines:	I've done a fair amount in SciTE4AutoHotkey
04:39:25	Dimitri Geerts:	Excel does not have regex functions, but you can add it in VBA if you want to use it.
04:39:57	Joe Glines:	Yes, but you have to add it, right Dimitri Geerts?
04:40:23	Geek Dude:	Google Sheets does support regex formulas
04:41:28	Ahren Groesch:	Because Regex looks like machine code witchcraft to the uninitiated.
04:41:31	Allan Smith:	No zero or more by default in word. Very frustrating
04:41:58	Dimitri Geerts:	https://www.spreadsheetweb.com/how-to-use-regular-expressions-in-excel/
04:42:45	Ben Sacherich:	Notepad++ Find and Replace has Regex support.
04:42:49	Mage Prometheus:	In LibreOffice regex are supported in Find & Replace and you don't have to replace. Find is very simple.
04:43:00	Jean Lalonde:	Well explained, Joe :-)
04:43:02	Brian Chamberlain:	‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìHow would you do the reverse of what I asked earlier, and build the list of common expressions to then look for? Like "user said" "I said" "they said" etc.
04:43:24	Geek Dude:	Wow! I had no idea regular expressions originated from the 50s. "Regular expressions originated in 1951, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular events." -Wikipedia
04:43:34	Joe Glines:	@Jean Lalonde I thought it was an awesome idea‚ùó
04:43:54	Joe Glines:	That's crazy GeekDude!
04:44:42	TAB Tation:	I turn it off all the time cuz I suc at vars
04:44:51	Joe Glines:	I didn't realize Isaias was a "woman hater"   lol
04:45:45	Cloaker Smoker:	come on down to parsing theory, we've got "oh my god so much math"
04:46:33	Darrell Metcalf:	DId Google Search use RegEx?
04:47:53	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	grouping
04:48:00	Geek Dude:	The problem is that RegEx works on the full original text, but search engines work on indexes. You can't really build an index that is meaningfully searchable using regexes
04:48:30	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	i like working with regex groups
04:48:34	Robert Rosenwald:	https://getbutterfly.com/regular-expressions-regex-in-google-search-console/
04:48:34	Brian McGinty:	The most important thing if you are new at regex is your don't have to come up with the perfect formula to do it all in one line.  It works to trim some away, store it in a varaiable, use more regex on the new smaller variable etc.
04:48:42	Descolada:	InStr is faster if you are looking only for one needle, but if looking for multiple needles then Regex might be faster? Because it would avoid going through the whole haystack multiple times
04:48:46	Joe Glines:	@Amen Brian!
04:49:06	Joe Glines:	@Descolada-  absolutely!
04:51:06	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	i sometime check out https://regexr.com/ for community regex patterns
04:51:09	Anthony Alvarez:	Thank you so much!!
04:51:34	Mage Prometheus:	I like Everything for indexing my file system and then regex to find files. so fast.
04:51:49	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	likewise @mage
04:52:41	Geek Dude:	https://github.com/G33kDude/RichCode.ahk/blob/master/Highlighters/AHK.ahk#L14
04:52:54	Geek Dude:	Here is a multi-line regex I split for clarity and to be able to comment
04:54:09	Joe Glines:	Thanks GeekDude
04:54:40	Ben Sacherich:	Thanks for showing an example of multi-line with inline comments.  I did not know that was possible.
04:56:46	Anthony Alvarez:	Can AHK be used to parse or write JSON data?
04:57:00	Cloaker Smoker:	yeah, there's a few libraries
04:57:02	Geek Dude:	^ $ . * + [] and ? are the most important symbols in my experience
04:57:21	Darrell Metcalf:	How do you use it for finding ID / ID value in Website source code?
04:57:24	Geek Dude:	Oh and \
04:57:38	Geek Dude:	@Anthony I use my library cJson for that
04:57:40	Dimitri Geerts:	A nice Site with Regex examples for ahk: https://daviddeley.com/autohotkey/xprxmp/autohotkey_expression_examples.htm
04:58:05	Cloaker Smoker:	@Anthony I'm legally obligated to suggest cJSON for JSON, since I had a hand in it. But autohokey-json is also very good, and widely used
04:58:09	Joe Glines:	Thanks Dimitri Geerts
04:58:18	TAB Tation:	Nice
04:59:22	Joe Glines:	https://the-Automator.com/cJSON?a
05:00:03	Cloaker Smoker:	fwiw the framework behind cJSON can compile nearly any standard C JSON library
05:00:13	Cloaker Smoker:	doesn't need to be a dll
05:00:29	Geek Dude:	What makes cJson special is that it outputs AHK objects rather than some other kind of data structure
05:00:55	Joe Glines:	Very cool GeekDude!
05:01:19	Geek Dude:	Someone else did their own implementation for v2 which I've heard works fine
05:01:33	Joe Glines:	Cool
05:02:21	Geek Dude:	https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=100602
05:02:23	Darrell Metcalf:	How would you use RegEx to find words in a URL search link then replace the search term with AHK?
05:02:25	Geek Dude:	This is the v2 one
05:02:54	Mage Prometheus:	visual studio code has some great json extensions to validate, underline errors in red, and create a tree view.
05:03:01	Cloaker Smoker:	@geek zoom breaks that link, strips the t=
05:03:02	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	possibly with RegExReplace()
05:03:02	Allan Smith:	Gotta be careful with it‚Äôs replacements and formatting sometimes in office
05:03:48	Ali Honarjoo:	Is there a way to read/write excel files without excel software? something like pandas in Python
05:03:51	TAB Tation:	I am here lol
05:04:16	TAB Tation:	ahh lol I am Thom
05:04:18	Geek Dude:	@Ali Yes there are libraries for it but you have to be careful because they don't offer 100% compatilibity
05:04:29	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	zip files
05:05:01	TAB Tation:	ppl don't know how I say my name
05:05:28	Ali Honarjoo:	Is ADODB.Connection for that purpose?
05:05:40	Geek Dude:	For what it's worth, the general difficulty of generating xls/xlsx files is why many websites just spit out .csv files
05:06:09	Ali Honarjoo:	Thank you Geek Dude
05:06:47	TAB Tation:	allan that is a nice ladder
05:06:55	Ben Sacherich:	I created an ahk that uses a series of Regex statements to format a SQL query statement.  Where is a good place to share it?
05:07:10	Joe Glines:	@Ben- the ahk forum
05:07:16	Geek Dude:	I would go to the forum to share that
05:07:37	TAB Tation:	@jean how you doing
05:08:39	Darrell Metcalf:	Regex for web scraping examples
05:08:47	Geek Dude:	Anybody doing things wit inis?
05:08:47	Jean Lalonde:	@Tom: Good :-) Have people home and can't be 100% in the call.
05:09:06	TAB Tation:	Ahren is thankinkg hard
05:09:20	Geek Dude:	Interesting things with INI files I mean
05:09:45	Ali Honarjoo:	And I think this is where you MUST use {} separately
05:10:20	Brian Chamberlain:	‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìwhat about looking for words you may not know that you are putting together a lot? Eg things that could be turned into a hotstring etc.
05:10:40	Geek Dude:	I don't think I've seen anything that does that before
05:10:58	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	extremely confusing and complicated to achieve. üòÅ
05:11:04	Joe Glines:	@Brian  I'd create a key logger and then run frequencies on it
05:11:06	Dimitri Geerts:	regex is casesensitive
05:11:21	Cloaker Smoker:	@Brain not sure I follow, but you can dynamically build a regex
05:11:27	Cloaker Smoker:	*brian lol
05:11:32	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	like saving everything you type then word cloud it
