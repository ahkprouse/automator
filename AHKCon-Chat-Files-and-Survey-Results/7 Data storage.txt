06:12:20	William Schnepp:	lETS aLL JUST uSE   weORD    :
06:12:30	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	hi everyone.... üòÅ
06:13:32	Dimitri Geerts:	This pol should be multiselectable...
06:13:37	Geek Dude:	It occurs to me that I don't really save user settings
06:13:42	Johannes von Bahr:	I usually use Notepad to store user data
06:13:57	Ali Honarjoo:	Agreed. multiselectable
06:14:02	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	i using txt ini html and json
06:14:25	Maciej S≈Çojewski:	‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìLast poll: there should be multi target choice as well, as it depends on situation: sometimes .ini is enough, sometimes .csv is more suitable, sometimes it is SQL.
06:14:39	William Schnepp:	I use  CVS a lot but want to use   SQL
06:15:37	Joe Glines:	sql is amazing!
06:16:04	William Schnepp:	what would be the advantage to using  .ini?
06:16:19	Geek Dude:	It's easy for users to edit directly
06:16:35	Dimitri Geerts:	I prefer not to use CSV files, as there is an annoying difference between Europe and America, AHK only default supports pasting the America CSV
06:16:54	Mage Prometheus:	I have a row of XML, XLST, etc, books from the 00s and I hate it so much
06:17:42	Allan Smith:	I got into the habit of using ini but now store json o each line
06:17:49	Descolada:	@William, ease of use for beginners (built into AHK), easier to edit directly, no fear of messing up the registry
06:18:04	Jean Lalonde:	@Isaias: the pool did not allow for multple anserws. The registry is not the "first" option .
06:18:28	TAB Tation:	tab is great
06:18:36	Joe Glines:	LOL Thom
06:18:45	Geek Dude:	Levitating man in business suit separated values
06:19:03	Brian Chamberlain:	üòÜ
06:19:06	Joe Glines:	GeekDude-  LMAO
06:19:27	Geek Dude:	oneüï¥Ô∏ètwoüï¥Ô∏èthreeüï¥Ô∏èfour
06:19:37	Mage Prometheus:	TOML is similar to INI files and much better
06:19:51	Brian Chamberlain:	@geek Love it
06:20:06	Enrique Casas Jimenez:	ASCII 31 üòÅ
06:20:13	Descolada:	To each their own :D oneüí©twoüí©threeüí©four
06:20:28	Brian Chamberlain:	ü§£
06:20:39	Geek Dude:	TOML beats YAML for not having the Norway problem
06:20:47	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	I was introduces to ini files when I used Red Alert 2 command and  conquer game, rulemd.ini to mode game
06:20:57	Geek Dude:	That is, the country code "NO" doesn't magically turn into "false"
06:21:29	Geek Dude:	I like JSON because the entire format is easily put into flow chart form (i.e. https://json.org)
06:22:20	Cloaker Smoker:	I like BSON because you can replace the B with üÖ±
06:22:52	Mage Prometheus:	When I serialize an object model to JSON I can understand it. XML makes me want to drink rum.
06:22:53	Ali Honarjoo:	power bi
06:24:38	Jean Lalonde:	Allow me to self promote the new version of my CSV editor application CSV Buddy: https://csvbuddy.quickaccesspopup.com/New in v3: Improved user interfaceMerge columnsAutomate with scripting
06:24:51	Robert Rosenwald:	This has been great. Got to go.
06:25:01	Joe Glines:	Cool Jean
06:25:12	Joe Glines:	We'll have to plan  a video soon on it @Jean
06:25:19	Joe Glines:	By Robert
06:26:15	Geek Dude:	Indexes are magical
06:26:24	Joe Glines:	Amen GeekDude
06:26:49	William Schnepp:	Programming has too many Options,,, it's good nut Dang it hard on the Brain
06:27:16	Geek Dude:	SQLite is good stuff. SQLite is the format of choice for data storage on Android, and it stores all your Browser data like history and bookmarks in Firefox and Chrome
06:35:14	Geek Dude:	Right, values can contain equals but keys cannot contain equals
06:35:39	Geek Dude:	That said, the treatment of equal signs may vary between libraries
06:35:40	Chad Wilson:	Moar>More ;)
06:35:44	Joe Glines:	lol
06:36:14	Mage Prometheus:	Also CouchDB. I love erlang/OTP and Elixer. Great languages/framework.
06:36:52	Anthony Alvarez:	is Cleaning data also called "data normalization?"
06:37:23	Joe Glines:	@anthony  Sometimes
06:37:58	Geek Dude:	Data normalization is the process of turning data that might be structured, say in a tree structure, into a set of tables that link together in a way that avoids the repetition of any data
06:38:03	William Schnepp:	AK scripiting Dogs???
06:38:18	Ali Honarjoo:	:)
06:38:35	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	dawgs to be persice
06:39:00	Joe Glines:	Tank got his "dawg-parrot"
06:39:19	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	üòÅ
06:45:48	Geek Dude:	I've gotta run üëã I'll catch you call next time!
06:47:21	Eugene Voon:	‚ùì‚ùì‚ùìWith storing of the user data in SQL, does that mean its possible for me to store "license keys" in a cloud-hosted DB then have programs I create be licensed using the license keys in the DB? But how fast would this "authenticating" be then?Asking this because I was thinking of trying to start a software solutions business and this was an idea of how to regulate use of the programs.
06:47:23	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	üëã
06:51:13	Allan Smith:	Leave some features server side
06:51:22	Ahren Groesch:	Most of your paying users aren't even aware of the hacked options. They don't care.
06:52:25	Eugene Voon:	Thanks yeah its not to fully secure the program. Its just so that I can regulate subscriptions
06:53:15	Joe Glines:	Yeah @Eugene
06:53:25	Jean Lalonde:	Have to leave. Thanks guys!
06:53:35	Chad Wilson:	@Jean \o
06:54:53	Joe Glines:	bye Jean
06:55:39	TAB Tation:	Tanks view is my life lol
06:56:06	Mage Prometheus:	All of the top subscription programs, like the adobe stuff, has been cracked. It doesn't help and angers the users with bloat and slowdown.
06:57:48	TAB Tation:	I still cant get in the mic lol says joe is the dictator
06:57:57	Cloaker Smoker:	well, when software you could "buy for life" is suddenly a subscription service, a regular person is going to be a lot more likely to pirate software
06:58:20	Cloaker Smoker:	there's generally a lot of bad faith related to subscriptions compared to a one time purchase
06:59:25	Joe Glines:	agreed @Cloaker Smoker
07:00:11	TAB Tation:	best answer every what works works
07:00:50	Mage Prometheus:	Exactly. Stop watching endless how-to videos and write some code.
07:01:46	TAB Tation:	I forget 80% of what I learned
07:02:19	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	its mid Night, I need to sleep, good day.
07:02:28	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	üëã
07:02:32	Chad Wilson:	@Arab \o
07:02:33	TAB Tation:	night
07:02:44	Chad Wilson:	@Arbab :)
07:02:58	Arbab Irfan (Xeo786):	o/
07:03:30	TAB Tation:	I think im good at AHK but I still ask Isasias stuff
07:04:35	TAB Tation:	Ahren you look so focused
07:06:01	Ahren Groesch:	They're just further along in the dark?
07:06:02	TAB Tation:	you don't know every thing?
07:06:40	TAB Tation:	how to google... if stack overflow went away we all would die
07:07:00	Mage Prometheus:	This has all been great. It's almost dark and I need to walk to the shops. Bye guys. üëã
07:07:02	Chad Wilson:	@TAB 99% of my life would be over :(
07:07:05	Noel De Bruin:	No one is born knowing everything. That is why there is training, reference documents, and other people to use as resources üòÜ
07:07:16	Chad Wilson:	@Mage \o
07:07:43	Anthony Alvarez:	Does anyone know of a hotkey script to position the cursor in KeePass2 search field? Can it be done?
07:08:35	Johannes von Bahr:	I have to go to bed. Thank you for today :)
07:09:51	Chad Wilson:	@Anthony On my Screen.
07:10:03	Joe Glines:	By Johannes
07:10:17	Joe Glines:	thanks @Chad
07:10:35	Anthony Alvarez:	Thank you so much @chad!
07:10:46	TAB Tation:	bored since I cant join,,,, so ,,, Ahren become a model, Dale love the background, Maciej your cam is in the front, Dimitrie you look like a stream gaming lol
07:10:49	Anthony Alvarez:	Does anyone know of a AHK script to open application software cheats sheets that is context sensitive based upon the active window?
